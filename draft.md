- cost estimation 
- time estimation 
- scoping 


## Designing 

> after planning phase we have to prepare the product architecture 

> the softeware architect analyze the requiremnts and set the high level structure of the future system descriping what component go where and how to interact btw each other 

> also select technologies for development 

> user experinecs and visual desgin can also be drafted at this stage 

> without this stage the next stage can not be happen 

## Development 
> Is the stage where the programmers use the architecture desgin to be implenented 

## Testing (QA)
> review the code and findout the bugs and errors to be fixed before the next stage 

## Deployment 
> when the product release to the user maybe it is combined with the last stage 
## maintenance 
> a feedback should constnatly gathered and the product should recive conistant update and support (fixes and new features )

## SDLC
how do you decide what your next step on a project is let's hope you're not relying on a role of the dice especially when the decision concerns something as costly as software development in that case we suggest a tried and true method like the software development life cycle or sdlc it's a standardized process that describes different stages of building highquality software sdlc was conceived in the 1970s as a way of formulating the development of large-scale Business Systems but it prevails today as a

reminder of What stages a product goes through on the way to eventual we hope success there are many methodologies addressing this sequence of stages that you might have heard of so today we will talk about the phases of sdlc and the methodologies applying [Music] them the father of the software development life cycle was a computer scientist and a director at Lockheed software Technology Center in Austin when instant wroy in his influential article managing the development of large software systems he described implementation

steps that are similar to what we use today there are generally six stages of software development covered in sdlc planning and Analysis it's sometimes also called requirement analysis or has analysis as a separate stage before or after planning all in all at this prolonged stage the product team collects business and use requirements about what the final product must do and how it should work cost and time estimation scoping and other planning activities all go here this is such an extensive phase

that we have several videos covering software planning so make sure to check them out after this one second is designing after the planning stage you prepare the product's architecture and design here a software architect analyzes the requirements and sets the highlevel structure of the future systems describing what components on go where and how they interact with one another they will also select a technology for development user experience and visual design can also be drafted at this stage clearly without

this stage the following one can't happen the next phase development is a stage where programmers use the architect's design to write code that will finally turn the vision into a real thing this is where some aspects of the final product will be first revealed to stakeholders then testing more quality assurance takes place testers and QA professionals review the products code and useability for bugs and errors so they can be fixed before the next stage deployment is when the product is released to the

users sometimes this stage is combined with the following one maintenance where feedback is constantly gathered and the product receives continuous updates and support this includes both fixes and new features sometimes there's a prototyping stage between planning and designing a prototype is a simplified version of the product used to validate the idea before any major work begins it doesn't even have to be coded the design can be used to receive feedback from stakeholders and users a prototype is the best way to

verify requirements with minimal effort and costs so the number of phases and their titles can differ depending on the specifics of the projects or a particular methodology but a common understanding Remains the Same you start with a plan then then you design and develop after that you test and then release a product but by itself sdlc is just a concept and it's used as a base for several models you apply that will give your project Clarity and help deliver the best results so what are they waterfall was the first software

development approach described in Rey's article back in the 1970s and it adheres strictly to the sdlc stages the main idea is that each stage starts only after the previous one is finished the timeline due dates and deliverables are clearly set the waterfall model was borrowed from the construction and Manufacturing Industries where it makes total sense you need to wait for the blueprints before laying any bricks this model is very straightforward and well defined and the team can focus on just

one phase at each point in time so the project is easier to manage but today it's fallen out of favor in the engineering World why the main reason is that it's the opposite of flexible whenever you need to make a change in requirements or design you need to roll back to stage one and do the whole cycle all over again what if at the Finish Line you've identified some unforeseen risks that should have been mitigated during planning when testing happens so late in the process and stages don't overlap it

inevitably leads to blown deadlines and budgets so in modern software development a different approach is used today agile philosophy is the king the agile Manifesto which was written by 17 software developers in 2001 was a direct response to the heavyweight waterfall methodology among its 12 principles there are calls to welcome change even in late development stages and to deliver software continuously and early agile solved the waterfall drawbacks in a few ways firstly the testing phase isn't separate from the building phase

but rather it's done at every iteration for example in scrum one of the Frameworks based on agile the development is broken down into smaller Cycles Sprints Sprints are considered to be part of the scrum development framework and they are short periods of time typically lasting from 1 to 4 weeks at each Sprint cycle the team Works through all stages at the end of the Sprint the finished piece of product is shown to stakeholders the short feedback loop allows devs to adapt quickly and find new approaches faster without

compromising the delivery date another key change that agile brought to the development life cycle is the approach to planning or more specifically to documentation one of the main values listed in the agile Manifesto says working software over comprehensive documentation but the assumption that agile teams use little to no docs is wrong in waterfall the idea was to create detailed documentation covering project goals and the working process as well as precise budget and time estimates for agile where change is

welcome this would be just a waste of time so the idea is to produce only essential docks that is just barely good enough yes this is a real term in agile plus it must be a collaborative effort where a tech writer asks the team for feedback and encourages others to share their ideas if you want to learn more about documentation types and how they're created we have a few videos you'll find useful while originally agile was more of a philosophy today it has loads of specific tools and techniques such Frameworks as scrum lean

extreme programming or conon are also classified as agile approaches even though they existed before the agile Manifesto was formulated they now fall under the agile umbrella each framework has its best applications and specific tool set apart from the aforementioned scrum there's a lean methodology that focuses on eliminating waste and at its core is a feedback loop for testing your assumptions it consists of three recurrent steps build which basically means drafting some version of the product such as an

MVP measure meaning collecting feedback and evaluating if this version of the product succeeds and learn drawing conclusions and deciding how you refine your product for the next Loop another framework called Extreme programming or XP uses the usual life cycle but emphasizes the technical aspect of development it uses such practices as test driven development code refactoring pair programming and more also kbon is more of a management method than a framework since it uses so-called conon boards to

visualize work for efficiency there are many more Frameworks in the Agile development process that can be used depending on what the team wants or the project requires around 2008 A New Concept emerged from agile that drastically changed how software is built and released today devops is one of the most discussed development approaches employed by such Giants as Amazon Netflix Google and Facebook it stands for development and operations devops introduces a cultural shift where different teams work

together developers qas and operations are no longer writing the code testing it and deploying and supporting the code apart from one another now they merge into a single team often having multi-disciplinary skills devops life cycle is typically visualized as an infinity loop representing the development processes on the left side and operations on the right side a team collaborates and communicates throughout each phase we have a whole separate video covering devops and a video series about all devops aspects you need to

know so check it out after this one what's important is that devops uses typical agile planning the product development has rough objectives outlined and only the few future Sprints are detailed so while agile is focused on identifying features that users will like devops make sure that existing processes are optimized and streamlined to do that devops uses CI CD continuous integration and continuous delivery or cicd is a set of principles that allow developers to deliver frequent code changes it means that

teams integrate code on a daily or even an hourly basis by merging code changes in a central repository and preparing for deployment at any moment basically all changes new features and Bug fixes are always ready to be deployed and the product can be updated multiple times per day continuously delivering value to users HubSpot shared that they add 200 to 300 deployments a day using cicd Netflix orchestrates over 20,000 deployments daily in 2022 11% of organiz Iz ation were considered high devops

performers and deployed 417 more times than low performers this is of course achieved by high levels of Automation and the infrastructure that connects all aspects of product delivery and a unified ecosystem although cicd facilitates agile practices such as getting feedback quickly and detecting errors in the early stages it doesn't require short iterations and introduces automation to the development life cycle even in agile introducing product changes can be a long process especially today when

technological innovations happen so fast and consumer needs change easily so cicd solves this problem by adapting in a short amount of time without disrupting the whole development flow and consumers get to see the new features added in real time and provide their feedback instantly for 60 years the phases of the software development life cycle remained relatively unchanged regardless of whether you're building a house a rocket ship or an app you will need to plan design build test deploy and maintain

the product what matters is the relations between these phases now when testers and devs collaborate or are even capable of doing the same job you don't need to separate those tasks much automation tools made it possible to do many things at the same time and shrink the cycle to days and hours agile and many models and approaches that spurted from it have remained relevant for decades perhaps they will last another decade or maybe a new hip technology will show us a more efficient way to follow the product development path

regardless we will keep you updated let us know if you enjoyed the video like And subscribe if you want more videos like this we'll see you soon in the next [Music] video yeah

## Business Requirements Document Explained: Your Blueprint for Project Success
any business Endeavor starts with an idea but for it to succeed there must be a plan that defines the goal to be reached and how to achieve it in software development that plan is a business requirements document let's imagine you want to build a house you found the right piece of property in a lovely neighborhood and you've even sketched a picture of a perfect house you've been dreaming about the project seems ready to launch straight away as you show the sketch to the developer it turns out that it's not

nearly close to start construction there's still a myriad of things to discuss developers want to know the details about the framing siding Roofing Plumbing insulation until you feel you're losing your sanity well unfortunately you can't build a house or a piece of software with an idea alone no matter how brilliant it is teams need tech documentation that transforms abstract ideas into concrete expectations and guides them throughout the project the business requirements document or BRD serves as such a North star Illuminating

the development path from concept to completion it explicitly clarifies the business aspects of the project including objectives resources costs and deadlines the BRD is written at the beginning of a project with two main purposes first it helps communicate the business needs and values of a project to managers investors and other decision makers this way they know what the project will take and what they can expect in the result on the other hand the BRD also includes highlevel technical information so it's second

purpose is acting like a bridge that connects non-tech stakeholders with software developers giving everyone a shared understanding of the project all that said a BRD is frequently created for presentation to a mixed audience of St holders now that you understand whether you need it at all let's talk about how to write it and what its main components are even though every project is unique there are some common sections worth including in a BRD and it all starts with an executive summary which is well

just that a short description of the Project's background and main target though it's usually just a few paragraphs long it must explain why you initiated the project at off getting back to our house construction example an executive summary could probably be something like the apartment we currently live in became too small for our family the kids want a dog but it all just won't fit parking is always a problem in our neighborhood we also spend too much time taking the kids to school so we need a bigger house with a

garage so that everyone gets more space and it must be closer to the school for a software project write about the specific challenges that you want to address and the proposed solution Solutions it's also the right place to provide relevant statistics or Market data to add credibility and justify the need for a project after you outline the high level scope the next section to fill out is the project objectives this part must describe the results you expect to achieve and how they contribute to your overall business

goals also include the specific metrics to measure project outcomes for building a house the objectives can be save 1our drive daily or every every family member has their own room for software projects you might write something like gain 100,000 subscribers by the end of Q4 2025 or decrease card abandonment by 40% by the end of Q3 2025 now that you've explained the wise it's time to talk about the what project scope is the section where you list the pieces of work that must be done during the project and the ones that must not

to fill it out break the entire ire undertaking into smaller blocks and Define the main deliverables in each of them as we plan our house the project scope can include tasks starting from make the design get permits and approvals and prepare the site all the way up to pave the driveway and Landscape the art oh and let's not forget about the mailbox you might also want a pool but it doesn't fit in your budget right now so you can add it to the out of scope part similarly the software project scope can list TX tasks

like redesign the checkout page develop the filter functionality or integrate with the review platform here you have to keep the balance be detailed enough to cover all the tasks to be done but avoid going down the rabbit hole list of the smallest activities also don't confuse project scope with product scope the project scope is broader and might include say pre-development tasks like conduct market research and gather requirements while a product scope is basically a list of features to be developed in the BRD the product scope

is defined in the functional requirements section as you're working on your house design some of the requirements can be a dog must have a kennel in the backyard the AC must be controlled remotely or there must be a guest room the functional requirements for software often come in the form of user stories sketching interaction scenarios and user Flows In this case they sound like this as an online Shopper I want to filter products by Price category and rating so that I easily find what I need or as a traveler

I want to choose airplane seats online so that I sit with my friends as you prepare the list of requirements it's worth talking to different stakeholders to get diverse perspectives and that's what our next section is about stakeholders are basically anyone who's affected by or can affect the project the stakeholders for your house construction project will be your family members members the architect the builders your future neighbors the local governing body that must give approval and so on in software projects there are

also many stakeholder groups with diverse interests some of them are actively involved in the project we're talking about development team members and the project manager other stakeholders are less engaged say c-level managers or investors might not deal with the project on a daily basis but still have a big impact on it end users are another stakeholder group as they have their own interest in the end product as you list stakeholders in your BRD specify their role in the project this way everyone understands who is

responsible for what okay so now we have the why what and who a good plan also specifies the when which gets us to the dreaded schedule and deadline section to keep your team accountable the BRD contains a schedule along with all important deadlines and critic Milestones that helps monitor progress and have stakeholders updated on the project at specific phases as you plan construction of the house you estimate the timing for each phase for example you expect all the preparation and paperwork to be done in one month then

the foundation to take 2 to 3 weeks framing to last for about another month and so on the software project can also be broken down into phases such as planning design development Etc we explain them in detail in our video about the software development life cycle so be sure to check it out estimate the time for each of these stages and specify the main deliverables to be completed by the end of each phase another vital estimation to include is the cost the financial statements section of the BRD contains

the estimated cost of each project phase as well as the funding sources both in construction and software development there are many estimation techniques for example if you or someone you know has already built a house before you can roughly calculate the costs based on experience that's analogous estimating you can also develop three different estimates for various scenarios optimistic pessimistic and well realistic then you can calculate the expected cost with the following formula multiply the realistic estimate by four

times its value add the optimistic and pessimistic numbers and then divide the whole sum by six this is a popular technique called threo estimating giving more weight to the realistic scenario another approach is to break down the entire project into smaller subtasks and how the people directly involved in doing the job estimate the required time and resources for each subtask the sum of their estimations will give you the approximate total that's called bottom up estimating it takes more time but the

results are usually more precise whichever technique think you choose remember that none of them is perfectly accurate all sorts of unexpected things might happen along the way so when estimating either time or money leave yourself some wiggle room just in case you know the financials part is often complemented by the cost benefit analysis where you compare the expected costs and revenues to determine whether the project is worth the investment after all the point of the whole thing is to make money isn't it the cost

benefit analysis usually looks like a table where one column lists the estimated spending and another contains anticipated gains the total values are then compared in the bottom line we have to admit that making a business requirements document takes a lot of work but hey don't panic just yet we're going to make this process a bit easier for you here are a few tips on how to write an award-winning BRD a good way to approach any Tech documentation is to refer to previous projects and learn from past experience

using an example or template instead of writing everything from scratch will save you tons of time as you gather information by the way the fancy name for this process is requirements elicitation involve different stakeholder groups it will help you look at the project from several angles and get fresh ideas some ways to elicit requirements are brainstorming sessions interviews observations workshops and surveys Define business bus context when writing down all the gathered information keep in mind that the BRD is

the document that will be read by investors top managers and other decision makers so the main point of the BRD is to provide business context also remember that you're not writing for computer geeks so be clear avoid technical terms jargon or abbreviations that might be misinterpreted yes better throw out all those idees apis and sdks you simply language and be concise this way people will understand you better and faster and here's another little trick that will help you get through to your readers add visuals such as pictures

diagrams graphs and charts human brains understand visuals better than text so employ imagery then once you have your business requirements document ready don't rush to present it to stakeholders validate the content first be sure to double no better triple check your thesis so no critical errors creep in try to get an expert on the subject matter to review your BRD and leave feedback okay now it seems we've covered everything and you're all set to create a phenomenal BRD remember that it's not

set in stone and can change along with Market situations company strategy or customer needs so be sure to review it quarterly or annually and adjust if needed let us know about your experience with the BRD in the comments section below and stay tuned for more project documentation explainers [Music]

**summary**
### Summary

The video discusses the importance of a business requirements document (BRD) in software development and construction projects. It explains that a BRD serves as a roadmap, transforming abstract ideas into concrete expectations and guiding the development team throughout the project. The BRD helps communicate the business needs and values to stakeholders, including managers, investors, and developers, ensuring everyone has a shared understanding of the project.

The key components of a BRD include:
1. Executive summary: Outlining the project's background, main objective, and proposed solution.
2. Project objectives: Describing the expected results and how they contribute to the overall business goals.
3. Project scope: Listing the tasks and deliverables to be completed, as well as those that are out of scope.
4. Functional requirements: Defining the features and user interactions for the project.
5. Stakeholder analysis: Identifying the different groups affected by or involved in the project.
6. Schedule and deadlines: Providing a project timeline with critical milestones.
7. Financial statements: Estimating the project's costs and funding sources.
8. Cost-benefit analysis: Comparing the expected costs and revenues to determine the project's viability.

The video also provides tips for creating an effective BRD, such as referring to previous projects, involving diverse stakeholder groups, using clear and concise language, and incorporating visuals. It emphasizes the importance of validating the BRD content before presenting it and regularly reviewing and updating the document to adapt to changing circumstances.

### Key Insights

🧠 The BRD serves as a bridge between non-tech stakeholders and software developers, ensuring everyone has a shared understanding of the project. By clearly defining the business needs, objectives, and technical requirements, the BRD helps align the project's direction and expectations across different stakeholder groups.

🧠 Effective stakeholder engagement is crucial for developing a comprehensive BRD. Involving diverse stakeholder groups, such as end-users, development team members, and executive-level decision-makers, can provide valuable insights and perspectives that enhance the BRD's quality and relevance.

🧠 The use of clear and concise language, coupled with the inclusion of visuals, can significantly improve the BRD's readability and communication effectiveness. This is especially important when presenting the BRD to a mixed audience of technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring that everyone can easily understand the project's scope, requirements, and expected outcomes.

🧠 The BRD is a living document that should be regularly reviewed and updated to adapt to changing market conditions, company strategies, or customer needs. This flexibility ensures that the project remains aligned with the evolving business landscape and continues to deliver value to the organization.

🧠 Leveraging past project experiences and using templates or examples can streamline the BRD creation process, saving time and resources. However, it's crucial to tailor the BRD to the specific needs of the current project, rather than relying solely on generic templates.

🧠 The cost-benefit analysis within the BRD is a crucial component that helps stakeholders and decision-makers evaluate the project's financial viability. By comparing the estimated costs and anticipated revenues, the analysis provides valuable insights that inform the decision-making process and ensure the project's strategic alignment with the organization's goals.

🧠 Thorough validation of the BRD content before presentation is essential to ensure the document's accuracy, completeness, and alignment with stakeholder expectations. This step helps mitigate the risk of critical errors or oversights that could undermine the project's success.

## Information Architecture: From Chaos to Clarity
do you have an information scent a what you ask an information scent a ux design term that describes a person's ability to predict what they will find after clicking a certain link every internet user has developed one we rely on it every day as we let our brains assess how strongly a link or a label smells of the information we're searching for and we can get very frustrated when the scent ends up leading us the wrong way matching a user's information scent might be one of the most important practices in ux design because when your

website is logically organized has clear intuitive labels and works according to user expectations they can easily find what they need or complete a task that's why no website exists without information [Music] architecture information architecture is the underlying logic of website that dictates how the content is structured and how all the parts relate to each other it's not a sitemap which is just an illustration of the website's Pages nor is it a navigation that exists to enable users to find specific

information on the site in fact information architecture is never visible to the visitors but it's there in every design decision created by UI and ux teams or not say you're creating an online shop you've got this great idea for a navigation system different categories of goods each with its own set of subcategories you think maybe I'll add another section for special offers a spot for new arrivals and a few other things it sounds like the perfect plan but as you start building the problems start your users who you imagined would

effortlessly glide through your site are now lost in a maze of choices they're clicking on clothing expecting to see men's and women's but instead they're greeted with a confusing myth mix of spring collection casual business and accessories they desperately pick one of the labels expecting to see a simple pair of jeans but they're taken to a page with an assortment of all types of items they try the search bar but instead of finding exactly what they need it brings up results that are barely related to what they typed

in as they explore the site further a myriad of other problems arise from Pages leading to Nowhere to outdated promotion it's a mess and no one in their right mind would have enough patience to stick around when you get information architecture right users don't even notice it just feels natural but when you get it wrong it's impossible to ignore and it can be the difference between a thriving online business and the one that Fades Into Obscurity so how do you build an effective information architecture that

doesn't put your audience into a fit of frustration actually you don't build information architecture you find it because your website logic will stem from two things that you must discover your users and your content so let's start by getting to know your customers if you think you already know your audience think again every ux and UI design project starts with customer research you try to understand people by gathering information it can be in the wild like watching people on the street or spying on your spouse as they

interact with a similar product or you can even invite some people to your office get them to perform tasks and take notes on what they do you won't need more than five participants this is a more professional approach and it's something you should do whenever you're building a new product or redesigning an existing one you will do it to discern their process and document the user flow userflow is a path taken by a user when carrying out a task like making a purchase or finding information a user

flow typically starts on the homepage and through a series of scrolling and clicking between Pages a person arrives at their goal a customer is guided through the user Flow by their information sent and that's what you will need to study what do they use to make the decision of where to go next what are their expectations based on the experience with similar products how do they see read and scan the page this information along with user interviews about user goals and desires will give you a pretty good idea of the content

and Pathways that your website should have which is why the next step is doing a Content inventory and audit what's the first thing you do when cleaning a messy closet you pull out everything that's in it and go through every item one by one that's the same thing you must do with your content whether you already have the website or just building one inventory all the content the first step is documenting no need to acquire a special tool for that just use any spreadsheet you're familiar with Note the name of the content what

it is like an article or an image its source and who created it what broad subject matter it relates to when it was created and the location of the raw files next is the hardest part determining your content's fate which means you will need a Content audit what should stay what should be updated what should be scrapped and how do you make those choices there are many factors determining if the content is here to stay one of course is performance if this content aims to generate traffic or drive sales how well does it succeed at

that look at your website metrics for answers and if the results are not that good think about whether there's something to improve or if you can remove the content all together the other factor is whether it reflects your own content guidelines is it structured and formatted correctly does it adhere to the same design principles is it even a good fit for your company's values anymore and last but certainly not least is how well the content supports user needs this may be difficult to determine so combine

analytics customer reviews and the minds of your best content Specialists to understand if the content answers user questions or provides needed information after ranking each piece of content decide whether you should leave it as is remove it from the website or find ways to improve it when you're finished get ready to have your content grouped and organized one of the most tried and true methods for ux research is card sorting basically you make users do your job for you a person who reflects your real user

is given a set of index cards with pieces of content that you've narrowed down from your audit like the types of goods you're selling they're then asked to sort these cards into categories you can do open card sorting where participants must create their own groups or closed card sorting with pre-defined categories or there's a hybrid option where some boxes are labeled and others remain blank now watch and listen see where they struggle what they find easy and how they make sense of the chaos their insights are

your treasure the key to creating an organized userfriendly experience this simple practice will reveal a ton about how your customers think do they put gaming consoles in Hobby or Electronics or maybe they create a separate group called Gamers is the Loyalty program combined with my account or maybe it's in the help desk section look for patterns did most people put certain cards together were there categories that everyone used or were the groups all over the place use the most common categories and

organization logic to create your first content hierarchy a basis for the information architecture card sorting is a special task that requires three times more people than traditional tests so consider inviting at least 15 participants next is navigation and labeling navigation is about how users move around your site in search of content it consists of buttons links and menus that are organized in a particular way you're probably familiar with an inverted L navigation with a horizontal bar at the top and the vertical column

on the side or with a drop- down menu a classic for websites with many categories of content typically online stores there's a minimalist and mobile friendly hamburger menu as well as a footer navigation which usually provides additional options that couldn't fit in the header besides every page has its own navigation depending on the type of content so a Blog won't look the same as the contacts page and sometimes websites provide alternative navigation for the same type of content maybe some users

like to shop by cloth type While others would rather view all clothing options for a particular activity navigation options are not endless so you will end up choosing among several existing methods to organize content how here are a few things to keep in mind first is deciding which design best supports the discoverability of the content and user flow you won't add your product options to the Carousel maybe it's better to put them in the tabs where users can see them all at once second is where on the page you should

Place navigation on YouTube where you're watching this video the list of related videos is placed to the right on the desktop version and at the bottom on mobile making sure that you already have your next video planned while you're still watching this one this is also a decision Guided by priority people come to YouTube to find something to watch so they're constantly navigated towards more viewing options while the rest of the functionality like comments or watch History is not as prioritized the next stage is labeling

which includes trigger words that best conceptualize what a user will see when clicking on a link you might get the navigation right but if you mess up labeling you're in trouble after all labels are the only thing a user can utilize to predict what happens next so what makes a good label first it should be simple but descriptive imagine imagine someone taking just a few seconds to scan your entire navigation this should be enough for them to know exactly where to look further use icons if you want to make

the site even more scannable and second it should be consistent regardless of how far the user drilled down on the website they should know exactly how your navigation works on each page let's do a quick recap your information architecture is formed by placing your content in the correct hierarchy which can be easily navigated using the appropriate navigation design and labels now how do you formulate it this is a website sitemap and it illustrates your website structure it's used internally to communicate the

organization of content to stakeholders and developers and is never shown to actual users a sitemap is one of the crucial documents in website design and it evolves with every stage of the design process whenever you update your information structure one of the first stages during which a sitemap is used is in creating a website's prototype a prototype is the first actual representation of the product and its information architecture it's not yet a website not visually or functionally but it can give a pretty good feel of the

final result to test all the design decisions that have been made so far while testing costs time and money it will save you plenty of both in avoided mistakes many would argue that you should test at every design stage and you might consider it but the one time when you should definitely test your design is here with a prototype of your information architecture once again you do that with actual people your potential users you create tasks and ask people to carry them out compare two different products

and decide which one you would prefer to buy or find out how many points you currently have on your account when you watch customers perform these tasks here are a few things you will want to take note of first is the success rate which is basically the percentage of participants who completed the task this is slightly basic and lacks Nuance but it's a good indicator of major usability issues for a more detailed success breakdown test findability or how easily participants can find content on a

website assign user specific task and observe how long it takes to complete them next calculate the average completion time shorter completion times indicate intuitive navigation while longer times may suggest confusing layouts or poor labeling another metric is first clicks after asking participants to perform a task you record how long it took them to make the first click this will help you see if there are any similar looking links that distract the customer or labeling problems that make them second guess or

or go the wrong way while these three tasks check Effectiveness and efficiency you might also want to test user satisfaction which is done via questionnaires there are a few existing actions you can ask participants to perform which will give you insight into their feelings about the product if you're lucky you'll get a ton of feedback on your first version of information architecture and be ready to move to revision for any product that is expected to grow information architect Ure isn't set in stone it will keep

evolving as your needs goals and values change and certainly with what you learn about your customers the content its structure and logic must be re-evaluated along with those changes you can always look at competitors when searching for inspiration but make sure that every decision is judged by your harshest critics the users you have the ability to mold their experience and almost any blunder obstacle or confusion can be fixed with smart and consistent navigation labeling and hierarchy if you want to learn more

## Estimate Software Development Costs
foreign is notoriously expensive to develop it's a complicated Endeavor in which a team of various professionals can be involved for months or even years software development is also not a very exact process yes when building a minor feature to perform a simple task you can be precise with how much funding such a project will require but if the product must solve a business problem this creates a lot of uncertainty and uncertainty isn't something you can easily put into calculations so how do we estimate software development costs

with this uncertainty in mind [Music] the lack of funding is one of the main reasons businesses fail not a reason per se it's more of a symptom of poor financial management how does it happen in our Tech driven World software is created all the time so why is it so difficult to prepare for future expenses the first mistake is something humanity is yet to solve our irrational optimism this is called the planning fallacy the concept that was first introduced in 1979. according to studies both in personal and professional lives people

overestimate that they will finish tasks earlier than they usually do and rarely consider their past experiences with similar tasks some teams also feel pressured by the stakeholders to provide smaller numbers when you know that the provided budget is way too low but you want to stay in charge you might agree to unrealistic commitments hoping that you'll fix the problem somewhere along the way besides stakeholders often expect an exact quote too early in the process before anyone knows what they're going

to build and how they're going to build it sometimes the discovery phase takes weeks or months to realize a fraction of the features that must be built not many clients are ready to wait for that but still expect realistic estimations it's practically impossible to make clear estimates at the project start look at this graph it's called The Cone of uncertainty in 1958 it was proposed as a standard for estimation classification for construction in the chemical industry and since then has been validated in project management

it illustrates that at the planning stage when the uncertainty about the product is the highest all estimates are massively different from the result it means that if the project is estimated to take a year to develop it may end up realistically taking from three months to four years but the more developers learn about the project and start settling on some specifications and design the smaller the uncertainty is as you can see even at the final stages some uncertainty remains and up until the deployment the exact duration of the

project might be unclear regardless stakeholders need estimates on the project timeline and budget so how to deliver them at such high levels of uncertainty you ballpark planning typically starts with documenting the project scope you ask large big picture questions and break them down into manageable pieces that you can assign to specific teams the scope is described in the work breakdown structure one of the first documents that projects start with it can look like a list a diagram or a Gantt chart but it's typically

presenting the hierarchy of tasks and deliverables the work breakdown structure allows us to sketch out the first version of the product backlog which will be the foundation for the team's work throughout the whole development process so how does it work if you take your family on vacation every year you can approximate how much it will cost you this year as well in project management this approach is called analogous estimating you take a look at a similar project conducted in the past and draw its data

on duration the number of people engaged and costs analogous estimating is always rough but it's useful when you're at the initial development stages and have very little information about the new project it's very easy and quick to do you only need an experienced PM or a team lead who's done similar work and can approximately say how long each feature takes to implement the Project's size can be measured in different units both absolute and relative take ideal days this is something familiar to any person who has

to plan anything really if you were to work without interruption how many days would it take you to finish it for example a designer knowing their past experience of doing similar tasks might estimate that it will take five days to design the home page but to be on the safer side they might double that to account for all possible interruptions or to simplify the matters you can use t-shirt sizes write a list of large features or sections of the app to be developed they're often called epics and

roughly estimate if it's a small medium large or extra large task you can then go look at the data from past projects see how many days it took you to finish tasks of similar complexity and use those numbers for a new estimate analogous estimation may work at earlier stages and if you have very little time but if you require something more precise you will need other methods take for example parametric estimating in parametric estimating you combine historical data with statistical modeling basically it's a step forward

from analogous estimating as it considers the difference between the past and the new project for example it took you seven months to do a similar project before and it cost five hundred thousand dollars so one month of work cost seventy two thousand dollars now the current project will take nine months to finish and since one month of similar work equals seventy two thousand dollars then the whole new project will cost six hundred forty eight thousand dollars and you can calculate the cost of any

unit of work not just a month for example you can estimate how the budget changes if you add more people to the team this approach is more reliable though it may be time consuming in more complex projects when you're estimating the cost of separate features and considering different variables another estimation technique is three point estimating as the name suggests you develop three separate estimates one is an optimistic estimate if everything goes as expected and all funds are spent efficiently the

second estimate is pessimistic the worst case scenario when the project goes over budget with massive overspending and finally the most likely estimate which reflects how it normally happens with some non-catastrophic expense losses then the final cost can be estimated using the following formula this formula is called program evaluation and review technique pert estimate and it's one of the most popular and widely used estimation techniques in project management it's considered to provide one of the most

accurate results among all methods besides this last one finally let's cover bottom up estimating as you might have guessed the bottom-up method makes estimates of work at the lowest level of detail and crawls up before calculating a sum of all tasks this estimation is done by experts that will be directly involved in delivering the tasks they're estimating so you can expect high accuracy here every team can report how long it takes them to perform a similar activity and then a project manager calculates how much they'll have

to be paid the crew can also highlight other resources and variables to be taken into account although inaccuracies will still happen they will level out in the final result of course such an approach requires more time and can increase the planning time and project costs as well if your project is time constricted and stakeholders aren't that concerned about budget accuracy it might not make sense to spend weeks doing precise calculations but bottom-up estimating may be done in high stakes Endeavors to give confidence to

stakeholders and reduce errors and overspending you must remember though that this initial ballpark estimation is just that an estimation it's not a precise plan and its only purpose is to help stakeholders understand how much work such a project entails the actual cost and effort can be calculated only during development so how is this done let's talk about story points in Agile development sections of the software to be developed or broken down into different levels the highest level is themes long-term

objectives shaping the product's overall strategy themes are expanded into different epics larger features and epics include several user stories stories are told from a user's point of view and highlight their desires and intent we highly recommend you watch our video on acceptance criteria for a detailed explanation of this concept the length and scope of software implementation are often measured in user stories for example a login feature consists of five user Stories the password recovery feature is two stories

and so on and they are also used to estimate the Project's effort using story points story points have been in use in agile teams for over 15 years and they're a bit more complicated than rough day estimates this method involves assigning tasks a certain value relative to their complexity for instance one is a simple task while eight is much more complex of course complexity is subjective which is why story points assignment is often a team effort here's how it works this is a practice called planning poker

each team member has a set of cards with numbers or any units that make sense to you such as the aforementioned t-shirt sizes then a product owner reads a user story from the backlog and the team discusses it after that each person selects a card that they consider an estimate of its complexity when everyone's ready the cards are revealed if all cards have the same number that's great you've got your estimate you can write down that this exact user story's difficulty is five but if everyone has a

different opinion the team continues the discussion and votes once again if the range of estimates is too big this indicates a different level of understanding or uncertainty within the team say someone is confident a user story deserves just two story points perhaps they know of a library that can automate the task or someone else that assigned it nine points sees hidden risks planning poker allows team members to come up with interesting insights and be more realistic about task complexity planning poker is most effective in

smaller targeted teams that are already familiar with a project and each other and it allows you to estimate how productive the team will be or its velocity in modern development work is usually done in sprints Sprints which initially came from the scrum development approach are short periods of time typically two weeks to a month when a team does a set amount of work the number of story points the team can complete within a Sprint is their estimated velocity basically it describes the team's productivity to

calculate anticipated velocity you simply add up the story points of all user stories that you plan to complete within a Sprint say all your story points added up to 200. if your velocity is 20 meaning that you expect to complete 20 points each Sprint then the whole development takes 10 Sprints or 20 weeks you add to that a Sprint at the start of the project and a Sprint for release preparation and you get your estimation of 22 weeks for the whole project velocity is typically measured after the

fact to help plan ahead so the estimated velocity of the first couple of Sprints may not be precise and it will even out as the team learns to predict their velocity better at the same time if the project has a deadline and should be completed in say 15 weeks the team can calculate how many user stories can be finished by that time and perhaps add people to the team to increase velocity or delay the deadline thus increasing the budget regardless of how detailed your estimates are a project manager will

keep track of the team's performance and update estimates at different development stages this is a project management triangle it illustrates three constraints of the Project's quality the project scope its features the Project's cost the resources and time its schedule and deadlines to make sure quality doesn't suffer a project manager must trade between them if stakeholders want more features then the product needs more time to develop and a larger budget given that we don't compromise quality of course if the

product is late for an important presentation then maybe we should prioritize some features and cut the scope or hire more devs and increase the budget the project rarely runs according to the original plan and schedule sometimes stakeholders want to take longer to discuss the product design the extra week that wasn't included in the first estimate a project manager will come to stakeholders pinpointing any changes to the plan and proposed Solutions that's the magic of the agile approach in development if it's not a fixed cost

project with detailed specifications angles of the triangles can be adjusted for the best possible outcome we highly recommend you watch other videos from our project documentation playlist if you enjoyed this one let us know and share your experience of making project estimates [Music] thank you foreign

## API Documentation and Why it Matters
foreign to the state of the developer Nation there are currently 24.3 million active software developers in the world that's more than the entire population of Florida or Australia techies are integral to making the world function optimally but unfortunately quite often they spend their time not creating value but trying to figure out how software that someone else created works as you know from our other videos on technical documentation writing docs is an extremely important part of creating software that users will love but what

if developers are the users let's talk about API documentation and why it matters [Music] if Engineers are helping the world connect then apis are the most useful tools in their toolbox as you may know application programming interfaces are pieces of code written and shared specifically to help software communicate they allow one software to access information or functionality from another software and they're everywhere whether we're aware of them or not so much so that we currently live in the

API economy API economy is the concept of using apis to improve and optimize your operations companies build their own apis to automate internal processes or use external open apis to gain access to a wide range of functionality in their own apps many companies wouldn't be successful today without using apis to jump start their services Distributing apis has also become a viable business model Salesforce surveyed 800 cios and it decision makers to reveal that a third of related businesses revenue is being generated by

apis Brands like Salesforce eBay and Expedia have become truly api-led by letting startups use their resources via apis large companies open up new relevance for themselves and contribute to Innovation what we have is a new and more efficient way to grow your business by using existing technology rather than creating everything from scratch so in a world where apis are a product for consumption you should put just as much effort towards creating and distributing them as you would with any software and a big part of that effort

must be dedicated to API documentation any API exists of two things the actual code and the documentation for using it what if you bought a Lego set to build your own Millennium Falcon and found that they forgot to put the manual in the box now all you have is a pile of Lego pieces that is worth nothing to you apis are the same Engineers need documentation to know what an API can do and how to request it and they need this information to be comprehensive and easy to understand see developers interact with apis every

day sometimes for over 10 hours a week searching for apis going on forums to ask about apis reading reviews of apis and rummaging in the documentation so if you want them to use your API consider developer experience just as you would user experience let's start by understanding how API docs are usually created most apis today are designed using an open API specification this is a standard format that allows devs to describe their apis in a language understood by humans and computers typically yaml

this is a sample of open API definition it's all pretty clear if you know what you're looking at there's a version of the specification then the name and description for an API and where servers are located finally here are the individual endpoints of an API this one allows you to request a list of users you can see response codes and their meanings 200 for ok 400 for an invalid user ID 404 for not found Etc in theory open api's Simple structure can help anyone make sense of an API without docs but this would be no

different from selling a Lego set in a big bucket with a black and white Manual of course you can still build a spaceship but it won't be as enjoyable as having all the pieces pre-sorted with the instruction printed in full color luckily open API also allows for automating DOT creation if your API is written in the open API standard tools like Postman or Swagger will pull sample requests code Snippets and examples from your collection and populate API docs with them this is a big improvement from

Simply reading the specification you can make no changes to these automated docs and distribute them among users as is but for many API creators this is just the beginning to make truly great API docs that developers will love you need to spend a bit more time on them how should you write documentation to elevate the developer experience one of the first recommendations we want to give is to address the entry level in your Docs Google creates some of the best documentation for its apis and it's no

coincidence that they are used everywhere all the time one of its success factors is how beginner friendly it is Google doesn't treat its users like pros and that's because they often are not among Google Maps API users are just people who want to display a map on their website or calculate travel times for a complex multimodal family trip Google understands its target audience and that it never consists of just one type of person generally always remember that your API docs can be viewed by not

only professionals but also decision makers or Tech journalists who just want to review and compare to Target them all target the least experienced group this includes writing in simple English adding links to useful sources and using visual aids the next thing you should be doing in your docs is following the existing user Journey in product management a user flow or Journey helps the ux team map out the app's layout to follow the natural progression of a user's thoughts and intentions and API users are users too

so how would they go about exploring your API first they'd like to know how this API can be helpful to them that's why most docs start with a what is section who can use this API and how what can it do then if they decide they want to use it how can they access it what is the authentication process and where can they get a key after that how do they actually start do they need to register somewhere else or tick some other boxes finally you can provide information about specific API functions examples

statuses and errors and dive into other details the third piece of advice for you is to stick to the known layout if you've seen a few API docs you've seen them all API information is typically organized in similar formats so it's intuitive to use most incorporate a two or three column layout with contents on the left the main document body in the middle and code examples to the right study the docs of a few popular apis to pinpoint best practices such as the contents always sticking to the side of the screen or

code Snippets in different languages also remember to keep your docs updated at all times an API is only as good as its up to dateness if you're using a software like Dapper docs or redokly your docs will be updated accordingly but you need a maintenance strategy all the same start by assigning someone responsibility for updates they will prepare docs to roll out along with updates remove deprecated data and analyze what endpoints might require more tutorials and Improvement also use the devs natural inclination to share

feedback and encourage them to rate the page and leave likes finally employ a person that knows how to write technical content a technical writer writing API docs means knowing how to translate jargon into words that people from different backgrounds can understand this is typically the job of a technical writer a tech writer is a person who's equally good at crafting sentences and understanding the underlying programming logic not only can they deliver sales copy to drive your API revenues they will also add

helpful descriptions links examples and tutorials before we send you off to create great docs let's look in detail at some examples HubSpot apis are used by those who want to build an app those setting up a custom integration and people looking to extend the functionality of their website the last group is often marketers without any Technical Training so HubSpot takes care of them in a few ways the start guide is short and straightforward and there's a section referencing Community forums and a slack

group where users can go for help HubSpot also has a free one and a half hour course demonstrating what the apis are used for and how to make them work note that HubSpot is currently transitioning towards a new generation of API but they keep supporting an older version with corresponding docs another cool example is stripe stripe is an API company so their docs are the main way to attract retain and communicate with customers an interesting section for review is the tour of the API where the main concepts are described in plain

English striped docs follow a familiar three-column layout with code samples and other important info on the right traditionally you can choose the library and copy the text in one click but note a Sleek switch between light and dark mode that many devs will surely appreciate every section ends with the was this helpful prompt for feedback Salesforce already mentioned a few times in the video also deserves a quick overview before they even start any integration users can review and compare different API types depending on the

supported protocols and use cases each type will in turn lead them to separate documentation which also starts with educational materials after a detailed quick start they have an abundance of examples with code samples to explore apart from these you might want to pick out some ideas from docs by twilio meta and MailChimp to name a few getting someone to use your product is what marketers and product managers of the world work hard to do in a world where apis are a product too this effort should spread to API creation whether

you want your internal API to be useful to your employees or capitalize on the service you publish commit to it and treat the API with the respect it deserves what aspects of tech documentation do you want us to explain next let us know and watch more videos in this series we'll see you next time [Music] thank you

## Acceptance Criteria: How to Meet User Expectations
that's it very good don't forget to speak very very clearly diagonally even the magical world operates best with clear instructions otherwise the consequences can be pretty unpleasant in software development though instructions are even more important hundreds of thousands of dollars and several man years will go down the drain if the engineers and customers don't have a common understanding of what the final product should be like that's why we have to document acceptable system behavior join us as we explore acceptance

criteria and learn how to meet user expectations [Music] in every project there's a big gap in understanding between a client and a doer even when they both speak the same language it can be hard to translate what a client wants the app to do into manageable tasks that engineers can work on so in the agile approach this communication is strictly formatted to eliminate any misunderstanding this format is called user stories we all speak the language of stories stories are how the world and the people

around us become interesting and whole that's why it's a great method to describe not just your app's features but also the user's desires and intent a user story follows a simple template as a type of user i want to perform some action so that i reach some goal features like password recovery favorite button or share screen gain much more contacts when rephrased as user stories you see the difference right a user story shifts focus towards solving actual problems and solving problems is not only more satisfying than checking

off abstract tasks but also a way more collaborative experience a team aimed to find a problem solution will come up with more creative features while user stories themselves are great for motivation communication and collaboration purposes they are not all that's needed to ensure that the product works as expected finally let's talk about acceptance criteria if you've seen our videos on software planning and documentation you might be unsure how stories are different from functional and non-functional

requirements and when do acceptance criteria come in well everything starts with user stories they describe what a person using your product should be able to do then we go into specific often technical details in requirements they describe how the software should provide that functionality to the user if the requirements answer the question how then acceptance criteria specify how exactly or what should happen if these criteria are fulfilled the feature is considered acceptable by the client it means it did its job exactly

as was intended as the user expected this format of writing acceptance criteria is simple and universal it's called rule oriented and it can even be found in real life in situations where strict rules are applied in software development though you sometimes need to be more specific some cases will benefit from a special method called scenario oriented acceptance criteria scenarios are sequences of actions a user must take they are typically written using given when then format which works like this

you start by describing the preconditions to the behavior that's about to begin if there are several preconditions you can also use the form and next you use when to describe the action a user is performing considering those preconditions finally write out the outcome of that behavior via then depending on the behavior you're describing a scenario can be extended with more preconditions actions and outcomes also if this sequence reminds you of test cases you're not wrong the given when then format can be used for

both user story description and testing helping qa decide if the feature is accepted or not that one scenario we've just created is one acceptance criterion and each user story should have at least one you can imagine how many criteria must be written so who creates acceptance criteria [Music] acceptance criteria must be written before any development starts because the product backlog is formed from user stories and their criteria the process is typically initiated by a product owner a stakeholder actively

involved in driving the product vision and providing feedback to the team but it's never the task of just one person a business analyst and a project manager often join in to review acceptance criteria before the whole development team gathers to brainstorm about solving a customer's problem this collaboration and a chance for everyone to write the criteria help the team embody the product vision and create a larger sense of purpose if you've been tasked with writing acceptance criteria there are a few

things to know first avoid telling how the user story should be implemented your focus is on what happens leave some space for developers to explore the best ways to transform the intent into the final product they might get very creative next phrase your criteria in the most concise simple sentences using language that anyone can understand people with no technical background managers and stakeholders should have the same understanding as the devs that's the whole point similar to user stories write criteria

in the active voice always indicating who acts and why a user is at the root of everything and this should remain clear one final piece of advice is to avoid negative sentences as they don't remove the vagueness if you don't want something to happen make a decision about what should happen instead otherwise you may not enjoy the result agile development is all about preparation that's why documentation is such a coveted topic in the community let us know what other types of product documents you want us to make a video

## What are Non-functional Requirements and How Do They Work?
look at these brand new laptops first one is a shiny pair book you can open it with just one finger so smoothly designed even dust can't permeate it its operating system is bulletproof reliable and so fast to boot up and then we have well adore book yeah it's a famous workhorse for nearly any task and while it also switches on in a flash it doesn't have pair books glory the question is which one would you choose both of them have everything you need to work a screen a keyboard speakers and a microphone similar connectivity ports

and a pile of other hardware and software it's what you expect from a laptop but that's not what makes the difference between the products because people want a thing not only to work but to work great that's why a pair book might look so alluring when we see a one finger screen flip fast buddha and rare breaks do these qualities look like they perform any function to you nope that's why we call them non-functional requirements so let's talk about what they are and why we need them functional and non-functional

requirements may not be easy to say 10 times fast but in reality both things help us describe different qualities of a product we build and they are equally important because they are part of our acceptance criteria if the product meets them it's considered ready functional requirements are basically a roster of things that explain what people should be able to do within the application that's our main focus when we build something functional requirements for the spoon would be a handle and a shallow round bowl so

people can hold it and grab food or take for example a social media app users can create a personal profile upload photos write posts or messages a person must be able to write messages to their friends will be our functional requirement since it points out the specific needs of people and features that can satisfy them for example a chat what about non-functional requirements well things are a bit more complicated there while functional requirements specify what a product should do non-functional

requirements specify how a product should do it also known as quality attributes these requirements describe the expectations about system properties some of the most common examples are performance or how fast the software responds scalability or basically how well it holds up under a certain load portability as a measure of how easy it is to port software into another device or operating system usability or how easy it is to complete a certain action security maintainability and the list can go on

and on take for instance our social media application a user may require a real-time messenger and even some smaller features like scheduled send as part of our functional requirements right non-functional ones would tell us how many users an application can handle at a time without helplessly freezing should we store all data or remove some for security purposes what latency for messages is considered good but who can tell us about those attributes and how do we define non-functional requirements

the truth is end users don't really know how fast convenient or scalable the software should be the bigger the better you might say but in reality it's not clear what bigger means in terms of say usability moreover there are dozens of aspects users don't know or care about so unlike functional requirements mostly expressed by the users non-functional requirements come as a result of research by the technicians software architects or analysts how do we run research to find them first and foremost non-functional

requirements can be derived from the product goals values and concerns for instance we want to build the safest messenger in the world so the product specifications will obviously include security and data integrity capabilities but they will also entail some constraints as long as government regulations and data protection laws like gdpr have an impact the second source for non-functional requirements is obviously the competitor market analyzing the competitors we can discover some standard system

capabilities that should be considered this way we can define what's considered good security on the market and take those system qualities as our requirement looking at your own existing technology is another way to understand non-functional requirements introducing new capabilities to the existing platform will obviously present some constraints and limitations for example we want to reach security by using modern protocols for data transmission but our existing environment simply can't handle it especially if we talk

about some bulky legacy systems that whisper surely once we define and gather all of the requirements we need to capture them so that the team can grasp the idea let's take a look at how to document non-functional requirements we usually express functional requirements as user stories for a social media app these could be the need to create a personal profile to upload photos to write posts to shoot and upload videos and many more now in terms of our non-functional requirements we want the application to

globally load pages within one second in this case a non-functional requirement would affect all functional requirements so it makes sense for us to document this as acceptance criteria for those four features because the desired response time will determine if a given feature is completed and behaves the way we want in software documentation non-functional requirements can often be seen in a definition of done section linked to the user stories it will affect but it's not only user stories we implement to reach these goals what we

also need are metrics and testing for non-functional requirements as any software attribute non-functional requirements should be measurable that's why we need to assign metrics as soon as we know what the requirements are for instance metrics like attack success rate are used to test security usability can be measured in the average number of clicks it takes a person to complete some task portability is evident when we know the percentage of non-portable code and all of those things are checked and counted during

the non-functional testing non-functional testing basically comprises different tests for performance scalability security usability and other attributes these tests are usually automated since non-functional requirements are global and critical to our application so running the tests automatically simply saves time while keeping track of those properties and it's not rare for a single requirement to address multiple attributes at once have a look we can express a non-functional requirement like this

chat rooms with 50 users online should have a 0.1 second latency for sending a message this means that we expect an application to respond nearly instantly when there are 50 users online and typing it once and this can be seen as a performance as well as a system scalability metric so let's wrap it up non-functional requirements are as important as functional ones they explain different aspects of the application although sometimes it's pretty hard to approach them and it looks like they're biting don't be

afraid just remember these three things as you stride confidently to your solution first while non-functional requirements are about architecture it's always more workable to focus on a part of your software instead of the whole product that's why we suggest defining non-functional properties for a specific component or group of them second link those requirements to your business objectives do you really need your application to be so portable to launch on literally any device you see sometimes great portability or

performance may not impact your user satisfaction that much but it will certainly take a large bite out of your budget and time and third look at the existing standards and guides it may become an unending task to understand what's required of your application remember you're not the first one to develop say an android app so there are guidelines and standards you'll want to consider benefit from other people's experience that's it don't forget to subscribe to our channel for more videos about software documentation and if you like

this one it takes only one click to tell us about it stay tuned [Music] you

### Summary

This video discusses the importance of functional and non-functional requirements in software development. Functional requirements describe what a product should do, such as the features and capabilities it must have. Non-functional requirements, on the other hand, specify how the product should perform, focusing on quality attributes like performance, scalability, usability, and security. 

The video explains that while functional requirements are usually expressed by end-users, non-functional requirements are derived through research by technical experts like software architects and analysts. Some key sources for non-functional requirements include the product's goals, values, and constraints, as well as an analysis of competitor products and the organization's existing technology.

The video emphasizes the need to document non-functional requirements and link them to the relevant functional requirements as acceptance criteria. It also stresses the importance of defining metrics and conducting automated non-functional testing to ensure the product meets the specified quality attributes.

The video concludes by offering three key tips: 1) Focus on defining non-functional requirements for specific components or groups, rather than the entire product; 2) Align non-functional requirements with business objectives to ensure they provide meaningful value; and 3) Leverage existing standards and guidelines to benefit from the experience of others.

## Software Planning and Technical Documentation
he's really putting you to work huh did you want to develop an app i'll pass clooty you're lost oh yeah why is that that's an app you'd want to develop can i ask what it is of course you can that's always the first step in app development in this episode of rick and morty jerry falls into a trap by agreeing to develop an app he knows nothing about the app is launched shortly and the world faces the consequences this is not something we have to worry about in real life but the show is parodying an actual startup

phenomenon the culture of hatching new products without much planning or preparation driven by excitement and the hope for success software development is never as easy as on rick and morty since presumably you don't have an alien on the team it's an expensive time-consuming and risky endeavor to have a chance at success you need clear communication elaborate planning and documented expectations how does this planning happen and what helps devs stay on course let's talk about software planning and

technical documentation luckily if you're building software you're not the first one to do that and even if you were you wouldn't be the first one to build something there are many parallels between software development and construction reflected not only in the wording but also in methods project management itself until very recently was a discipline associated with civil engineering and manufacturing that's why in continuation of the practice for many decades software products were built like tangible ones

look at the now discredited waterfall model according to it the project should follow a few consecutive steps gathering product requirements preparing the design then implementing said design doing some testing and finally performing maintenance and system support this approach seemed logical because software was treated like buildings or ships or any big construction projects where you do massive amounts of work first and then apply changes where needed this of course led to failed deadlines overgrown

teams and thousands of lines of code rewritten over and over again only very recently 20 years ago to be more exact this thinking has changed the agile manifesto questioned the traditional approach and brought the new idea building software is an ongoing endeavor where planning should happen along with execution and testing today we enjoy how the agile principles help us lower risk and always have the ability to change something if needed this is mostly accomplished thanks to great documentation which just like any

other element of agile project management is subject to change through as many iterations as needed so what documents are used in software planning software planning is in many ways synonymous with software documentation because technical docs is where software starts taking shape it's where the idea of a ride sharing app becomes a complex system with its business logic text specifications and user flows and where we first determine the path to this transformation ultimately docs help us answer two big

questions first what should the product be like this part of project management is described in product documentation the second question is how are we going to build this product it's covered in process documentation strap in as we dive deeper into both these groups and we'll start with the what question a product is a system with a set of features that helps users achieve their goals in software development these features are called functional requirements and the properties this system should have are the

non-functional requirements both are expected by a stakeholder or an end user to fulfill the product's main purpose a user should be able to check the order status on the main screen is a functional requirement that talks about user capabilities a system must support one hundred thousand users at the same time is a non-functional requirement because it describes the capabilities of the product how fast it is what security measures it uses how the system must grow such concise statements translate user

and stakeholder desires into requirements that developers understand and can then plan to implement a product requirement document is one of the first created requirements are largely dictated by users they're basically the result of all the user research done earlier when the team talked to real life people and learned about their preferences and experiences this research though results not only in the feature list but in other invaluable pieces of information for example in user personas a persona is a detailed description of a

typical user that makes it easier for the dev team to visualize what the people want need and how they behave the behavior of a persona is then broken down into user scenarios about people accomplishing a task often represented in comic strip form scenarios help designers understand a future user's thought process and motivation scenarios are broken down even further into specific user stories that look very similar to end features a user story is written from the point of view of a user persona and looks

something like this as a busy manager i want to receive automated reports so that i'm always up to date with metrics or as a parent i want to control what content my kids are watching to keep them safe these user research docs help compile deliverables more documentation with product prototypes wireframes and user journey maps these describe the future and many testing iterations later final user experience okay so we describe the features and the product design time to talk about technology one of the first technical decisions a

team has to make is a product's architecture although the main three architecture layers apply to most applications many products require complex custom architectures and these design choices are described and visualized by a software architect architecture depictions are usually pretty schematic but they communicate to the team what components and design principles should be used without many tech details what should be pretty technical is a testing plan in agile development testing happens along with engineering not after and if

you're using a popular approach called test driven development you'd be writing test cases based on requirements before you even start any serious development work if you've seen our video on qa you should know that test cases are detailed descriptions of what features should be tested and how step by step all test cases make up the test plan which gives some time frames and assigns roles to qa engineers and developers in this process so let's recap all this time we've been talking about product planning

requirements ux architecture and testing strategy being some of the first documents created in preparation for development to tell the team what type of product they will be building but we also need to document how it should be built with all its processes organized around the product not surprisingly this branch of work is called process documentation the father of project management henry gantt created his famous gantt chart more than a century ago and in the agile era it's still one of our favorite

planning tools most product roadmaps are based on the gantt design that's how software devs list their objectives prioritize tasks and assign deadlines there's a strategy roadmap with high level goals and rough delivery estimates it shouldn't be detailed because you need to view the whole project on a single screen then we go low level with the technology roadmap which lists the smallest deliverables and their due dates finally a release roadmap has strict deadlines for when each part of the project should start functioning and

what features go live when apart from the schedule process documentation includes metrics and standards project metrics are meant to provide regular feedback on how fast and effective the work is metrics are the main tools of the agile development process that help spot any bottlenecks and problems in the code quality before they proliferate and stall the whole project similarly standards and guidelines both for coding and ux people set up best practices that every team member regardless of when they join the project

or what their experience is can use to create consistent code and design now you may have looked at the whole scope of document creation and wondered what's agile about that you won't be the first to ask that question why do so much planning if the idea is to check your hypotheses fast and move on to the next one well there are a few reasons first is despite how flexible the agile processes are meant to be they only work that well because of great organization you don't have to be certain about the

task but you need to know the scope of it what it affects and what complications may arise but some mistakes can and should be prevented rather than embraced in the process for example even though user testing is conducted throughout the development journey you don't want to start working on features before you do user research here overpreparation will save you time and money and finally written documentation remains the best communication tool for big groups and projects this is how your new devs will learn the project details

and the old ones will remember them this is your main source of truth in case of conflict and this approach makes it easier to access information rather than asking someone or doing research that's already been done stay tuned as we continue this topic with a series of videos on technical documentation let us know in the comments what you want to learn from our future explainers [Music] you
