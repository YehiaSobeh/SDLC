# Software Development Life Cycle

> It is a standarized proccess that descripe different stages of building high quality software . a way of formating the development of larg scale system

> sdlc is a concept (set of phases ) and there are money methodologies aaddressing the sequence of the stagges .

> there are main 6 stages of softer development coverd in sdlc 

## planning and analysis (requierment analysis )
> or we can split them into analysis and planning 

> at  this prolong stage product team collect buisness and user requierments about what the final product must do and how it should works 

- cost estimation 
- time estimation 
- scoping 


## Designing 

> after planning phase we have to prepare the product architecture 

> the softeware architect analyze the requiremnts and set the high level structure of the future system descriping what component go where and how to interact btw each other 

> also select technologies for development 

> user experinecs and visual desgin can also be drafted at this stage 

> without this stage the next stage can not be happen 

## Development 
> Is the stage where the programmers use the architecture desgin to be implenented 

## Testing (QA)
> review the code and findout the bugs and errors to be fixed before the next stage 

## Deployment 
> when the product release to the user maybe it is combined with the last stage 
## maintenance 
> a feedback should constnatly gathered and the product should recive conistant update and support (fixes and new features )
